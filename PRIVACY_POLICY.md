**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Introduction

OPALWISH (OPC) PRIVATE LIMITED ("we", "our", or "us") operates the TapKit mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in relation to the TapKit application.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

**TapKit does NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data.** We have designed the app with privacy as a core principle.

### We do NOT collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Device identifiers (UDID, IMEI, MAC address, etc.)
- Location data
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports or error logs
- User behavior tracking
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All data generated within the TapKit app is stored **exclusively on your device** using local storage mechanisms. This includes:

- **Calculator History**: Your calculation history is stored locally on your device
- **Notes**: All notes you create are stored locally on your device
- **QR Code Scan History**: Your QR code scan history is stored locally on your device
- **App Settings**: App preferences are stored locally on your device

**Important**: None of this data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers. All data remains on your device and is only accessible to you.

## Permissions

TapKit requests the following permissions:

### Camera Permission
- **Purpose**: To scan QR codes and barcodes using the device camera
- **When Used**: Only when you actively use the QR Scanner feature
- **Data**: The camera is used in real-time for scanning only. No images or video are stored, except for the text content extracted from QR codes (which is stored locally on your device)

**You can deny this permission** and still use the Calculator and Notes features. The QR Scanner will only function if camera permission is granted.

## Third-Party Services

TapKit does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection services.

### URL Launcher
- When you scan a QR code containing a URL, the app may open that URL in your default browser
- This is done locally on your device and no data is transmitted to us

## Data Security

Since TapKit stores all data locally on your device:
- Your data is protected by your device's security measures
- We recommend using device lock screens, encryption, and other security features provided by your device manufacturer
- If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be deleted

## Children's Privacy

TapKit does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we do not collect any information, the app is safe for users of all ages, including children.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy
- Including a notice in the app if significant changes are made

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal information:
- You have full control over your data stored locally on your device
- You can delete any data by clearing the app data in your device settings or uninstalling the app
- All data stored in the app is accessible only to you on your device
